# AWS Provider Examples
This directory contains Terraform configuration files showing how to create specific resources. The create-vpc is intended to demonstrate how to create a vpc along with the route table, the subnet and security group. The launch-instance contains both the vpc configuration we used above and the instance provisioning configuration. 
For details on how to run these samples please refere to my [blog post (Launch an instance with a static website on AWS) >>](https://brokedba.blogspot.com/2020/10/terraform-for-dummies-part-2-launch.html)
# Terraform Console:
- Although terraform is a declarative language, there are still myriads of functions you can use to process strings/number/lists/mappings etc. 
you will find an excellent all in one script with examples of most terraform functions in terrafunctions.sh
