# AWS Provider Examples
This directory contains Terraform configuration files showing how to create specific resources. The create-vpc is intended to demonstrate how to create a vpc along with the route table, the subnet and security group. The launch-instance contains both the vpc configuration we used above and the instance provisioning configuration. 
For details on how to run these samples please refere to my [blog post >>](https://brokedba.blogspot.com/2020/10/terraform-for-dummies-part-2-launch.html)
