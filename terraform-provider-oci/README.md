# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Provider Examples

This directory contains Terraform configuration files showing how to create specific resources. 
The create-vcn is intended to demonstrate how to create a vcn along with the route table, the subnets and their security lists.
The launch-instance contains both the vcn configuration we used above and the instance provisioning configuration .
 For details on how to run these samples please refere to my blog post 
 https://brokedba.blogspot.com/2020/07/terraform-for-dummies-launch-instance.html



`` Please run either one of them at a time ( apply and destroy before runing the other) as the vcn attributes are the same .
