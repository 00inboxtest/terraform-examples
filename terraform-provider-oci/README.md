# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Provider Examples

This directory contains Terraform configuration files showing how to create specific resources. 
The create-vcn is intended to be demonstrate how to create a vcn along with the route table, the subnets and their security lists.
The launch-instance contains both the vcn creation configuration along with configuration to create an instance that uses the same vcn.
 
` Please run either one of them at a time ( apply and destroy before runing the other) as the vcn attributes are the same .
